Methodology

The top 100 pool contains only Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with populations of above 250,000 and per capita GDP levels of above $40,000. The top 25 cities were selected based on an index (scaled from 0 to 100) that captured a total of 18 variables within 5 groups, with weightings applied to each group as follows.

Employment Prospect (Weight = 31.58%)
1. Employment rate in the 20-24 age group
2. 2. Employment rate of working-age degree holders

Economic Prospect (Weight = 21.05%)
3. Per capita personal income
4. Per capita real GDP
5. Median income

Quality of Life (Weight = 21.05%)
6. Housing affordability index
7. Quality-of-life index
8. Amenities index

Social Prospect (Weight = 15.79%)
9. Population size
10. Percentage of population aged 20-29
11. Median age
12. Percentage of working-age population who hold a bachelor’s degree

Career Trajectory (Weight = 10.53%)
13. Employment levels in management, business, science, and arts occupations
14. Median income in management, business, science, and arts occupations
15. Employment levels in service occupations
16. Median income in service occupations
17. Employment levels in sales and office occupations
18. Median income in sales and office occupations

All variables in the Quality of Life group (housing affordability, quality of life, and amenities) are scaled based on research results published in a 2015 paper by David Albouy, titled What Are Cities Worth? Land Rents, Local Productivity, and the Total Value of Amenities. The amenities index includes factors of weather, average slope of land (presence of mountains), coastal proximity, crime rate, air quality, availability of bars and restaurants, and availability of arts and culture services. The quality-of life index is based on a series of scaled economic factors that express the cost of living, the price of capital, wages, tax rate, quality of life, and productivity.

All other data come from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Diverse Representation of Different Types of Cities

Many cities in the top 25 list might look familiar to you, but there are a few surprise candidates as well. To test the diversity of representation in the top 25, a “K-Means” clustering analysis had been conducted to assign the 100 cities into 5 groups, according to how similar they are to each other, based on the combination of the 18 variables used in the ranking. 

Note that in the top 25 list, 4 of the 5 identified groups are represented. This means that the representation in the top 25 is diverse, and not overwhelmingly biased towards cities that have the same characteristics.
